# Water-Management-System
We code a program to collect a data that how much amount of water flowed or used by single house. Using that data we send a report to respective
office and also to the members of house describing that how much amount of water flowed. We also set a limit of water usage and if that limit exceeds
they need to pay money to continue flow of water. So the motive of the project is "Water for all".
